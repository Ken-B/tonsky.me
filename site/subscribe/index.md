Three ways: RSS, Mastodon or Patreon.

## RSS

This blog delivers updates via [RSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS). To use it, you need _a reader_.

1. Register at one of the services or install an app. Good list of hosted RSS readers and apps can be found [here](https://zapier.com/blog/best-rss-feed-reader-apps/). I use [Feedly](https://feedly.com/).
2. Add my blog to the sources. Usually "`tonsky.me`" would work, but if it doesn’t, try this: "`http://tonsky.me/blog/atom.xml`"
3. Enjoy!

This is how my blog looks like in Feedly:

## Mastodon

You might follow [@nikitonsky@mastodon.online](https://mastodon.online/@nikitonsky) on Mastodon, everything I write here I announce on Mastodon as well.

## Patreon or GitHub Sponsors

If Twitter is too much noise for you, [patreon.com/tonsky](https://www.patreon.com/tonsky) or [github.com/sponsors/tonsky](https://github.com/sponsors/tonsky/) should work too.

Become a patron and you’ll be notified about all the articles and other stuff that I do.
